# What the hell is Roll the Dice via Console?
Nothing special, just quickly made console based randomiser, which can help you play DnD or any other game meant for one dice (no matter the sides).
Start it, decide number of sides and enjoy the real game. That's it, really.

# Why I actually even decided to deploy this nonsense?
There can be many reason, regardless the size of the project. Let me explain.
### I had 2 main reasons:
   - Create as minimalistic and as clean code as possible, yet still keeping the Clean Architecture standards (tho there isn't any Infrastucture part, neither proper GUI)
   - Finish project and see release options of GitHub for my wider (and more serious) projects
### But we can point out more:
   - No project is too small to start with and finish it - Even small project of such can have some challenges and since we're going from a scratch to a very end, we'll get in touch with all parts/phases of a process. This can supplement a solid ground, which will provide some basic experience needed for the future projects.
   - Mental impact - IT industry is very relentless and stressful place. Fully finishing some project will provide you with something to look at years later and compare how far you've got since then (I strongly recommend that).
   - Widen the portfolium - Something visible for others, which doesn't crash on every 2nd occasion. Is it too simple for even being a thing? Well yes, but it's better than nothing :)
   - It never ends - Beauty of GitHub is that yourself or anybody else can just expand your little nonsense into something more interesting or complex. You can keep in mind who actually put a first stone in.

# I found an issue with your project!
Bless you :)
